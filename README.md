## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate the glycerol steam reforming process using ASPEN Plus or DWSIM.
- Analyze performance metrics such as hydrogen yield, reaction selectivity, and thermal efficiency.
- Investigate the effects of different catalysts (Ni, Ni/CeO₂, Ni/ZrO₂, etc.).
- Propose modifications to enhance sustainability and economic viability.

## 🔧 Methodology

- Developed a process flowsheet using mixer, Gibbs reactor, heater, flash separator, and compound separator units.
- Performed material and energy balance analysis across all units.
- Studied the impact of temperature, steam-to-carbon ratio, and catalyst choice on hydrogen yield.
- Validated simulation results using literature data and expert feedback.

## 🗂️ Key Results

- **Optimal Temperature**: 700 °C gives maximum H₂ production (11 kmol/h).
- **Catalyst Optimization**:
  - Ni-based catalysts with cerium oxide enhanced coke resistance and reaction stability.
  - Cerium oxide improves oxygen mobility and prevents carbon deposition.
- **Production Boost**: Achieved up to 20% increase in H₂ yield using Ni/CeO₂ catalysts.
- **Material & Energy Balance**: Verified across all streams in the DWSIM model.

## 📈 Flowsheet Summary

- **Input**: 2 kmol/h of glycerol (Stream S-01)
- **Output**: ~11.23 kmol/h of hydrogen (Stream S-12)
- **Reactor Conditions**: Operated under isobaric conditions, optimized at 700 °C
- **Software Used**: DWSIM (open-source ASPEN alternative)
